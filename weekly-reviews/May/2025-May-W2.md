## Key Learnings
### Classes
- Templates for creating objects with shared methods and properties
- Syntax:
```
class MyClass {
  propertyName = value;
  constructor() { /* initialization logic */ }
  method() { /* method logic */ }
}
```
- Class methods are non-enumerable and defined on prototype
- Classes always use strict mode internally
- Only one constructor method allowed per class

#### Class Fields
- Declare properties directly in classes without using constructor
- Set on individual instances, not on prototype
- Arrow function methods maintain lexical `this` binding

#### Static Properties and Methods
- Defined on classes rather than instances
- Called directly on classes: `MyClass.staticMethod()`
- Often used for utility functions
- Declared with `static` keyword

#### Private Properties
- Prefixed with `#` symbol: `#privateField`
- Cannot be accessed outside class definition
- Must be declared upfront in field declaration
- All private identifiers within a class must be unique (except getter-setter pairs)

#### Inheritance
- Uses `extends` keyword to create subclasses
- Child classes inherit properties and methods from parent
- Constructor in subclass must call `super()` before using `this`

### ES6 Modules
#### Import and Export Basics
- Two primary types: default exports/imports and named exports/imports
- ES6 modules use static imports (resolved at compile time, not runtime)
- File paths require strings, not template literals

#### Named Exports
- Can be declared inline: `export const varName = value;`
- Can be exported after declaration: `export { varName, funcName };`
- Must be imported with exact same names: `import { varName } from "./script.js";`
- Can be renamed during import: `import { varName as newName } from "./script.js";`

#### Default Exports
- Only one default export allowed per module
- Can be imported with any name
- Syntax: `export default expression;` or `export default function funcName() {}`
- Import syntax: `import anyName from "./script.js";` (no curly braces)

#### Re-exporting/Aggregating
- Modules can relay exports from other modules
- Useful for creating "index" files that consolidate exports
- Syntax: `export { default as func1, func2 } from "./script.js";`
- Can combine default and named exports: `export { default, namedExport } from "./script.js";`

#### Module Organization
- Entry point: Main file that imports from other modules
- HTML only needs to include the entry point script with `type="module"`
- Modules automatically use strict mode
- Modules have their own scope (variables aren't added to global scope)

### npm
#### Basics
- Repository of JavaScript packages and command-line tool
- Used to install, manage, and update project dependencies
- Commands include: `npm init`, `npm install`, `npm uninstall`

#### package.json
- Central configuration file for npm projects
- Lists project dependencies and their versions
- Contains project metadata and npm scripts
- Updated automatically when installing/uninstalling packages

#### Required Fields
- `name`: Package identifier (lowercase, no spaces)
- `version`: Following semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

#### Optional Fields
- `author`: Format is "Your Name email@example.com (https://example.com)"
- `description`: Short explanation of project purpose
- `scripts`: Custom commands that can be run with `npm run script-name`
- `dependencies`: Packages required for production
- `devDependencies`: Packages only needed during development
