# 2025 May Week 2

## Weekly Objectives Review
- TOP JavaScript tic tac toe project – Completed
- TOP JavaScript classes – Completed
- TOP JavaScript ES6 modules – Completed
- TOP JavaScript npm – Completed

## Key Learnings
### Classes
- Templates for creating objects with shared methods and properties
- Syntax:
```
class MyClass {
  propertyName = value;
  constructor() { /* initialization logic */ }
  method() { /* method logic */ }
}
```
- Class methods are non-enumerable and defined on prototype
- Classes always use strict mode internally
- Only one constructor method allowed per class

#### Class Fields
- Declare properties directly in classes without using constructor
- Set on individual instances, not on prototype
- Arrow function methods maintain lexical `this` binding

#### Static Properties and Methods
- Defined on classes rather than instances
- Called directly on classes: `MyClass.staticMethod()`
- Often used for utility functions
- Declared with `static` keyword

#### Private Properties
- Prefixed with `#` symbol: `#privateField`
- Cannot be accessed outside class definition
- Must be declared upfront in field declaration
- All private identifiers within a class must be unique (except getter-setter pairs)

#### Inheritance
- Uses `extends` keyword to create subclasses
- Child classes inherit properties and methods from parent
- Constructor in subclass must call `super()` before using this
- `super` keyword provides access to parent class methods and constructor
