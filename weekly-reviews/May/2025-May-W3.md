# 2025 May Week 3

## Weekly Objectives Review
- TOP JavaScript Webpack – Completed
- TOP JavaScript OOP principles – Completed
- TOP JavaScript linting – Completed
- TOP JavaScript to-do list project – In progress

## Key Learnings
### Webpack
- Static module bundler that creates dependency graphs from entry points
- Combines multiple files into single output
- `src` directory: source code workspace
- `dist` directory: bundled output for deployment

#### Configuration (webpack.config.js)
- `mode`: Sets optimization level (development/production/none)
- `entry`: Path to main application file
- `output`: Bundle destination settings with optional clean property

#### Asset Handling
- HTML: `HtmlWebpackPlugin` injects bundle as script tag
- CSS: `css-loader` reads files, `style-loader` applies styles
- Images:
  - CSS images handled by `css-loader` automatically
  - HTML images require `html-loader`
  - JavaScript images need `asset/resource` rules and explicit imports

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
#### Syntax Rules
- Strings must use double quotes only
- No trailing commas in objects/arrays
- No comments
- Properties must be `"key": value` format
- Only serializable data types permitted

#### Data Type Restrictions
- Allowed: strings, numbers, booleans, null, objects, arrays
- Not allowed: undefined, NaN, Infinity, functions, Date, Set, Map

#### JSON Methods
- `JSON.parse()`: Converts JSON string to JavaScript object
- `JSON.stringify()`: Converts JavaScript object to JSON string
- Hydration: Process of transferring server state to client-side HTML

### Linting
- Static code analysis before execution
- Catches syntax errors and style inconsistencies
- Enforces coding standards across teams
- Improves code readability and maintainability

### Object-Oriented Programming Principles
#### SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility: Each class/method has one reason to change
- Open-Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution: Subclasses must be substitutable for parent classes
- Interface Segregation: Classes shouldn't implement unused interface elements
- Dependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
