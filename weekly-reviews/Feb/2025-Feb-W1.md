# 2025 February Week 1

## Weekly Objectives Review
- TOP first JavaScript project – Completed
- TOP JavaScript arrays and loops – Completed
- TOP JavaScript DOM manipulation and events – In progress

## Key Learnings
### Arrays
- Arrays store ordered collections of various data types
- `const` arrays can be modified (push, pop, etc.) but not reassigned
- Zero-based indexing for element access

### Loops
- Loop types
  - `for...of`: Array iteration without index needs
  - Standard `for`: Counter-based iteration
  - `while`: Condition checked before execution
  - `do...while`: Guarantees at least one execution
- Flow control
  - `break` exits loop completely
  - `continue` skips to next iteration
- Increment operators
  - Post-increment `i++` uses then increases, pre-increment `++i` increases then uses
  - Ensure proper increment/decrement conditions to avoid infinite loops

### Clean Code Principles
- Use descriptive, consistent, and searchable naming
- Write comments explaining "why" not "what"
- Use git for version control instead of comments

### Project Insights
- Problem-solving steps
  - Write logic and pseudocode
  - Break down problems
  - Implement solution
  - Test functionality
- Scope management through local variables
- String capitalization: `string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1)`
- Random number generation: `Math.floor(Math.random() * n)`

## Next Week's Focus
