- TOP JavaScript asynchronous code – Completed
- TOP JavaScript APIs – Completed
- TOP JavaScript intermediate Git – In progress

## Key Learnings
### Promises & Asynchronous Programming
- Promises: Objects linking producing code (time-consuming operations) with consuming code (result handlers)
- Executor function: Runs when creating new Promise, calls `resolve()` for success or `reject()` for errors
- Promise chaining: Each `.then()` receives previous handler's return value and passes processed result to next handler
- Error handling: `.catch()` handles rejections, equivalent to `.then(null, errorHandler)`
- Cleanup operations: `.finally()` runs regardless of outcome
- Parallel processing: `Promise.all()` waits for all promises, returns array of results, rejects if any fail
- Race conditions: `Promise.race()` resolves/rejects as soon as first promise settles

### Async/Await
- `async` functions: Automatically return promises, declaring asynchronous behavior
- `await` keyword: Pauses function execution until promise resolves, replaces `.then()` chains
- Error handling: `try/catch` blocks handle async operation failures
- Multiple promises: Combine `Promise.all()` with `await` for concurrent operations

### APIs
- APIs: Servers designed for external data consumption, often require API keys for tracking and abuse prevention
- Fetch API: JavaScript interface for HTTP requests, returns `Promise` with `Response` object
- Basic usage: `fetch()` accepts URL string or `Request` object plus optional configuration
- Cross-origin safety: Safe requests use `GET/POST/HEAD` methods with limited custom headers
- CORS requests: Cross-origin requests must meet safety conditions for methods and headers

### To-Do List Project Takeaways
- Modular architecture: Separated concerns into distinct modules (appLogic.js, domController.js, storage.js)
- State-driven UI: Single `updateAndRenderTodos()` function redraws interface based on application state
- Data persistence: `localStorage` integration with object rehydration using `rehydrateProjects()` function
- Event delegation: Single parent listener handles events for dynamically generated content
- Dynamic DOM manipulation: Creation of dropdowns, notifications, and form validation feedback in JavaScript
