# 2025 April Week 4

## Weekly Objectives Review
- TOP JavaScript library project â€“ Completed

## Key Learnings
### Library Project Implementation
#### Object Constructors
- Used constructor functions with `this` to create book objects
- Added methods to prototype for read status toggling
- Generated unique IDs with `crypto.randomUUID()`

#### DOM Manipulation
- Created dynamic UI elements with `createElement` and template literals
- Used event delegation for handling multiple button events
- Managed modal dialogs with built-in `showModal()` and `close()` methods

#### Form Handling
- Captured form data using `FormData` and `Object.fromEntries()`
- `preventDefault()` cancels default form submission
- Implemented form validation with conditional logic

#### Data Management
- Used array methods like `findIndex()` to locate objects
- Updated UI state with data model changes

#### Accessibility Considerations
- `aria-live="polite"` for non-intrusive notifications
- `aria-required="true"` for input field requirements
- Help text for form field guidance

#### CSS Technique
- Used CSS positioning to center modal dialog
- Positions element at 50% of container, then offsets by 50% of element size
```
position: relative;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```
