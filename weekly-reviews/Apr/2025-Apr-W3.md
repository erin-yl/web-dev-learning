# 2025 April Week 3

## Weekly Objectives Review
- TOP JavaScript objects and constructors â€“ In progress

## Key Learnings
### The `this` Keyword
- References the current object where code executes
- In methods, refers to object the method was called on (before dot)
- Value depends on how function is called, not where it's defined

### Constructors
- Functions called with `new` keyword to create objects
- Named with capital letter (e.g., Person)
- When executed with `new`:
 - Creates new empty object
 - Binds `this` to new object
 - Executes constructor code
 - Returns new object
- Use `new.target` to verify function was called as constructor

### Methods and Context
- Methods lose `this` binding when called separately from object
- Use `bind()` to maintain correct `this` reference
- `call()` and `apply()` methods execute function with specified `this` value

### Prototypes
- Every object has a prototype it inherits from
- Prototype properties/methods are shared among all instances
- Access with `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`
- Modify with `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, prototype)`
- `obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)` checks if property exists on object itself

### Prototypal Inheritance
- All prototypes inherit from `Object.prototype` by default
- Methods work with current object even when inherited
- Property lookup flow:
  - JavaScript checks object itself first
  - If not found, traverses prototype chain
  - Returns `null` if reaches end of chain without finding property
- Loop behavior:
  - `for...in` includes inherited properties
  - Other methods only work with object's own properties
- Keep object-specific state in instance, shared behaviors in prototype
