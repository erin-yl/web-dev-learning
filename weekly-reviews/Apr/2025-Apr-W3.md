# 2025 April Week 3

## Weekly Objectives Review
- TOP JavaScript objects and constructors â€“ In progress

## Key Learnings
### The `This` Keyword
- References the current object where code executes
- In methods, refers to object the method was called on (before dot)
- Value depends on how function is called, not where it's defined

### Constructors
- Functions called with `new` keyword to create objects
- Named with capital letter (e.g., Person)
- When executed with `new`:
 - Creates new empty object
 - Binds `this` to new object
 - Executes constructor code
 - Returns new object
- Use `new.target` to verify function was called with `new`

### Methods and Context
- Methods lose `this` binding when called separately from object
- Fix with `bind()`, arrow functions, or maintaining context
- `call()` and `apply()` methods execute function with specified `this` value

### Prototypes
- Every object has a prototype it inherits from
- Access with `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`
- Modify with `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, prototype)`
- Place shared methods/properties on prototype to save memory
- `obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)` checks if property exists on object itself

### Prototypal Inheritance
- All prototypes inherit from `Object.prototype` by default
- Property lookup traverses prototype chain until found or reaches `null`
- Methods work with current object even when inherited
- `for...in` iterates over object's own and inherited properties
- Object-specific state should be on instance, not prototype
