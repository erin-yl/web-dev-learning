# 2025 January Week 2

## Weekly Objectives Review
- TOP JavaScript variables and operators – Completed
- TOP JavaScript data types and conditionals – Completed

## Key Learnings
### Variables and Data Types
- Practiced variable declarations using `let` and `const`
- Understood immutability with `const`
- Explored primitive data types

### Conditionals
- Switch vs. if-else statements
  - Switch statements are better for comparing a single variable against multiple fixed values.
  - If-else statements are better for evaluating multiple conditions or complex logical expressions.

### Operators
- Common mistake

```javascript
// Incorrect
if (x === 5 || 7 || 10)

// Correct
if (x === 5 || x === 7 || x === 10)
```

- Logical operators
  - OR `||`: Returns first truthy value
  - AND `&&`: Returns first falsy value
  - NOT `!`: Highest precedence
