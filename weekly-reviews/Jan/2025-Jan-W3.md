# 2025 January Week 3

## Weekly Objectives Review
- TOP JavaScript developer tools – Completed
- TOP JavaScript function basics – In progress

## Key Learnings
### Chrome DevTools
- Explored CSS features, mobile simulation, and debugging tools
- Practiced debugging workflow: set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables

### Document Object Model (DOM)
- Represents web page structure as nodes and objects
- Allows JavaScript to dynamically modify document content, structure, and style
- Serves as bridge between HTML documents and programming languages

### Function
- Core concepts
  - Declaration: Declared as separate statements, available before definition
  - Expression: Created inside expressions or another syntax construct, only available after definition

```javascript
// Declaration
greet();  // Works
function greet() {
    console.log('Hi');
}

// Expression
greet();  // Error
const greet = function() {
    console.log('Hi');
};
```

- Scope & best practices 
  - Local variables: Accessible only within functions
  - Global variables: Available everywhere, use minimally
  - Naming: Start with action verb (e.g., `getUser`, `calculateTotal`)
  - Single responsibility: One function, one task
